### Changelog (v1.0.0 → v1.1.0)

#### Summary
- This release adds continuous-heating limits, LERP-based room selection, improved hysteresis handling, cooldown/candidate fixes, and documentation (flowcharts and spec updates). It also includes several bug fixes and performance improvements.

#### Highlights
- Add max continuous heating time per room and cooldown behavior (input_number.max_continuous_heating_min), with persistent per-room heating timers and safeguards to prevent a single room from monopolizing heating.
- Implement LERP-based room count selection driven by outdoor temperature (lerp helpers), replacing the previous tiered mode for smoother behavior.
- Fix hysteresis logic and demand model:
  - Rooms now heat until the offset threshold (hyst_off) and use a new _has_demand() predicate to correctly apply two-threshold hysteresis.
  - Fix inverted hysteresis offset threshold so rooms stop heating above the setpoint by hyst_off, not below it.
- Replace in-memory heating timers with persistent input_number.heating_minutes_<room_id> helpers to survive restarts and improve observability.
- Add mermaid flowcharts (FLOWCHARTS.md) documenting per-tick decision flow and overall architecture.
- Various robustness fixes: cooldown logic, initialization on restart, LERP edge cases, and logging improvements.

#### Notable merged PRs
- #1 Add continuous heating limits and LERP-based room selection
- #2 Fix cooldown logic: redundant condition, restart initialization, and floor-stuck scenario
- #3 Fix hysteresis: rooms now heat until offset threshold instead of stopping at onset
- #4 Add mermaid flowcharts for decision flow documentation
- #5 Fix max continuous heating time bypass when rooms are temporarily disabled
- #6 Fix inverted hysteresis offset — rooms disabled before reaching setpoint

#### Detailed changes
- **Continuous heating limits and LERP selection**
  - New helpers and logic to limit continuous heating time per room and to compute max concurrent rooms via linear interpolation based on outdoor temperature.
- **Hysteresis and demand model**
  - Added _has_demand() to keep heating rooms until _satisfied(); fixed calls to use this helper in candidate building, floor demand, and floor scoring.
  - Corrected _satisfied() formula to use Tuser + hyst_off.
- **Persistent timers**
  - Replaced in-memory room_heating_start with input_number.heating_minutes_<room_id> counters.
- **Cooldown and candidate selection fixes**
  - Ensure rooms exceeding max_continuous_heating_min are excluded regardless of side-effect flags; avoid bypass when rooms are temporarily disabled.
- **Documentation**
  - Added FLOWCHARTS.md with mermaid diagrams and updated spec home-assistant-heat-orchestrator-spec.md.
- **Misc**
  - Logging, performance optimizations, .gitignore, and other small fixes.
